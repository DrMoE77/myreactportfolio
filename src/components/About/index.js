                    <p> The most recent work for me was at Priceline Wentworth Point. up until March 2022. In 2019 I went overseas for a while with my family and when I returned, I was studying full-time for my Master of Pharmaceutical Medicine and doing some locum work. 
I am a pharmacist; I am also training to be a lawyer. I have completed five University degrees and I am currently completing my PhD. I am completing my full-stack development course and will be moving on to a data science course. I wanted to learn code so I can apply my knowledge and ideas in the areas of Medicine and Pharmacy, innovative science and technology and even in the Law.

In my PhD I am conducting research that involves both the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and Arizona State University (ASU). This research requires deploying surveys and collecting data from both Australia and the United States of America.

Medicine and Pharmacy

Medication reminder app and data science collection for my research with UTS-ASU. I plan to implement what I learn into this research.
